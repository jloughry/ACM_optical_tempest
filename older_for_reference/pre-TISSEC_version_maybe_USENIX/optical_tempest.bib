  abstract = {Covert channels have traditionally been categorized as either
    storage channels or timing channels. The author questions this
    categorization, and discusses channels that cannot be clearly identified as
    either storage or timing channels, but have aspects of both. A new model of
    timing channels is presented, which allows for channels that have
    characteristics of both storage channels and timing channels, and a method
    is given for constructing all channels in a computer system that have
    timing channel characteristics. Since R.A. Kemmerer's (1982) shared
    resource matrix methodology has the potential to detect all channels that
    have storage characteristics, the two methods jointly have the capability
    to construct all channels in a computer system. The approach to timing
    channels provides a justification of specific mechanisms for reducing their
    bandwidth which were employed in the VAX Virtual Machine Monitor.},
